Project Overview
This repository presents a Python-based project demonstrating my capabilities in web scraping, data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning. The project showcases a complete workflow, from data extraction to model deployment, aimed at predicting target outcomes with high accuracy.

Key Features
Data Collection: Leveraged web scraping techniques using requests and BeautifulSoup to collect comprehensive data on Kawasaki bikes from Bikewale.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Processed and refined raw data into an analyzable format using Python libraries, primarily Pandas and NumPy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize and explore data trends, correlations, and patterns essential for feature engineering.
Machine Learning Model: Developed and trained a logistic regression model achieving 91.3% accuracy, with the model serialized using Pickle for deployment purposes.
Tools and Libraries:
Python Version: 3.10.9
Libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dataprep, sklearn (for Logistic Regression), and Pickle.
Additional Dependencies: CMake, installed at C:\Program Files\CMake\.
Project Structure
scratch.ipynb: Main notebook containing code for data scraping, processing, analysis, and model training.
data/: Folder where raw and processed data are stored.
models/: Serialized model files saved for reuse.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sandysandee/python-developer-application.git
Install Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Execution
Open scratch.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Execute each cell sequentially to replicate the data collection, analysis, and modeling workflow.
Results and Performance
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 91.3%, indicating effective feature engineering and model tuning. The final model is designed for potential future integration into a production environment.
